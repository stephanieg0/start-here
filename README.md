## Intro
Welcome to the Craftwork cheat sheet! This page has everything you need to make it through the Craftwork workshop. If you don't see the next step, or you have questions that aren't answered by the [FAQ](workshop/FAQ.md), don't be afraid to raise your hand and ask us!

If you are viewing this as part of a ATO workshop, here is a [link to the slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18AIorSzf-h6JpZh0nXUg_wQzhCh7llE4/view?usp=sharing).

## Part 0: Join the org

In order for you to get access to the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and follow along, you will need to join the [github-craftwork](https://github.com/github-craftwork) organization. Coincidently we have written some automation to make that work. 

Invite yourself to the organization by typing  `.invite me` in [this issue](https://github.com/github-craftwork/start-here/issues/100).

Once you have submitted your comment, head over to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/github-craftwork/start-here/actions?workflow=Invite+a+contributor) for the the repo to find action triggered by your comment. 

Note that  this could take up to 30 seconds to show. Also be sure to check your email for that invite.

## Part 0a: Open a PR

Now that you are in the org you can make a PR that adds your self to the [attendee.txt](attendees.txt). The PR should automatically close thanks to another action created. 

Try to figure how all that worked while we wait for the rest of the group to join the organization.

Once you have pontificated enough, compare your thoughts with this explanation â€” click the link below for the explanation here.
